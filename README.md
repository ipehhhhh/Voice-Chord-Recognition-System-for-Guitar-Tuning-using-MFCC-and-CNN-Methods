# Voice Chord Recognition System for Guitar Tuning

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Audio Processing System for recognizing guitar chords using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods. The system is trained on a dataset that includes sounds from various types of guitars, covering 8 different chord classes. It achieves a chord recognition accuracy of 80%.

## Features

- Audio processing for guitar chord recognition.
- Utilizes MFCC, BFCC, and CNN methods for accurate classification.
- Trained on a dataset with sounds from different types of guitars.
- Achieves an 80% accuracy in chord recognition.

## Datasets

The dataset used for training the system is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabianavinci/guitar-chords-v2].

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project, including:

1. Setting up the development environment.
2. Loading the pre-trained models.
3. Running the chord recognition system.
